# Introduction

-   Why does your project matter?

For our group project, we decided to pursue an analysis of sleep health using a dataset sourced from "https://kaggle.com/" .The dataset, named sleephealth, contains 400 rows and 13 columns, with multiple different variables related to individuals' sleep patterns and every day lives. We used R and quarto to set up a website and used R language to analyze, visualize and manipulate the information within the dataset. Through various statistical summaries and data visualizations we explore patterns and correlations that provide information between sleep health, demographic factors, and lifestyle choices.Workforce productivity is a key driver of economic prosperity and is linked to factors such as sleep duration and quality. The observed variations in sleep patterns across different occupations underscore the potential impact on professional performance and productivity levels. As industries increasingly recognize the importance of employee well-being, insights from this study can inform policies and workplace practices aimed at optimizing sleep health. It also can provide information for employees of their employees general health based on varying factors such as gender and age. The identification of associations between stress levels, physical activity, and sleep duration provides valuable insights for employers seeking to create environments that better provide employee health and economic efficiency in the workplace.

Occupation_counts <- table(Sleep_Stats$Occupation)
Occupation_counts

#Summary statistics for Sleep Duration
skimr::skim(Sleep_Stats$Sleep.Duration)

#Summary Statistics for Quality of Sleep
skimr::skim(Sleep_Stats$Quality.of.Sleep)

#Summary Statistics for Physical Activity Level
skimr::skim(Sleep_Stats$Physical.Activity.Level)

#Summary Statistics for Stress Level
skimr::skim(Sleep_Stats$Stress.Level)

#Summary of BMI Category
#Count Occurrences of each category in the BMI Column
category_counts <-table(Sleep_Stats$BMI.Category)
category_counts

## Data Transformation

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
#Gender/Physical Activity
ob_sum1 <- Sleep_Stats %>% 
  group_by(Age, Physical.Activity.Level) %>% 
  summarise(Physical.Activity.Level_tot = sum(Physical.Activity.Level, na.rm = T),
            Age_mean = round(mean(Age, na.rm = T), 2))
#Pivot Longer _ 



```

```{r}
#| results: asis
#| echo: false
rmarkdown::paged_table(ob_sum1) 
```

# Example Title {.unnumbered}
